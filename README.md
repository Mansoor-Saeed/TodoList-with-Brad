# TodoList-with-Brad

This is a simple To-do list app, which works diretly on browser without saving any data into the database. 
As it is one of my starting project, I have not learned about databases yet. 
You can add simple tasks by submitting data inside the input field. 
It also clears the input field and keep the focus on input after the data is submitted.
Delete button is working and it deletes the specific item from the list. 

Thank you.
